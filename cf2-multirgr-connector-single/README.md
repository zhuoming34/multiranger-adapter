##Crazyflie 2.0 expansion board template

This repo contains a Crazyflie 2.0 expansion board template in the form
of a KiCad project. The template already contains the schematics, component mapping
and layout with the expansion connector. To make it easier to use the template
it also contains the Crazyflie 2.0 boardoutline and key components on the Eco1.User layer.

Here's an overview of the pinout of the expansion header:
